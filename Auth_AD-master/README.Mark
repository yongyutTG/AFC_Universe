Auth_AD - A simple Active Directory authentication library for the 
CodeIgniter framework

Handles:
- Login
- Logout
- Checking login status
- Checking group membership

This library is based on the previous excellent work of several people,
most notably Auth_Ldap by Greg Wojtak (gwojtak). This library is a 
simplified and cleaned up version specifically aimed at authenticating 
using a Windows Active Directory (AD).

The code for the method ldap_escape() was borrowed from 
douglass_davis [at] earthlink dot net from his comments on the ldap_search 
function on php.net.

See? Open source works!
