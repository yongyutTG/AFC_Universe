INSTALLATION

Copy the following files to the corresponding directories in your 
CodeIgniter project's 'application' directory:

  config/auth_ad.php
  controllers/Auth.php *
  libraries/Auth_AD.php

*) The file 'Auth.php' in the 'controllers' directory is an optional 
example controller file that shows how to use the Auth_AD library in your 
application.

Now first edit the 'auth_ad.php' file in the 'config' directory. This file
should contain your own AD settings for use in your application's 
authentication.

TIP: Do *NOT* *EVER* use your domain admin account as the proxy_user. That 
is very very very bad security. It is often best to create a specific user 
per application so you can easily manage security on a per-application 
basis.

Rob's tip: with my modifications to the original scripts, you can use
your application to log in as a domain admin. No need to place admin
credentials in a config file.
